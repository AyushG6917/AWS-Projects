# ☁️ AWS Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my AWS Projects repository! This collection contains hands-on projects designed to demonstrate practical knowledge of **AWS Cloud**, **DevOps practices**, and **cloud-native architectures**.

I’m currently learning the **MERN stack** as well, and many of these projects will eventually be integrated with full-stack features.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each project has its own folder with:
- 📜 `README.md` (description, architecture, steps)
- 🛠️ `CloudFormation / Terraform / Shell Scripts`
- 📸 Architecture Diagram(s)
- 🧪 Test Cases or Output Screenshots
- 🌐 [Live Demo (if deployed)](#)
